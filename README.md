I’m @Comptr-user

I'm interested in graphics programming and rust code (even though those two don't mix perfectly well at the moment)

I am _trying_ to learn Rust, however lack of executive function keeps getting in the way (I'm working on that though)

My pronouns are stuck in development hell, but they _might_ be She/Her
